[toc]

---

Create a Web Application that creates a Data Visual Representation of the Grade Distributions for Professors and Courses at Virginia Tech that also aggregates information from [koofers](https://www.docsity.com/en/), [RateMyProfessor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/), [Coursicle](https://www.coursicle.com/), and also maybe a feature to inform you of openings in certain course sections like [Course Pickle](https://www.coursepickle.com/).

## Preliminary Planning steps

Select a Frontend Framework/Library to use:

- [`React.js`](https://reactjs.org/)
- [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/)
- [`Angular` (aka `Angular2`)](https://angular.io/)
- etc

Learn [`D3.js`](https://d3js.org/) to use for creating the interactive data analytics. Research/Gather other resources to pull information from and apply. Check to see if there are APIs or other resources that can be utilized and document them.

### Grade Distribution and Course Data

Here are some resources to use

###### ***[Virginia Tech Grade Distribution:](https://udc.vt.edu/irdata/data/courses/grades)***

This is not an API, it is where you can download a file with the grade distribution data. Can Download as an Excel Sheet or `.csv` file (among other options).

###### ***[Rate My Professor Python Web Scraper:](https://github.com/Nobelz/RateMyProfessorAPI)***

Python Package that scrapes Rate My Professor data.

###### *Alternative* ***[Rate My Professor Python Web Scraper:](https://github.com/tisuela/ratemyprof-api)***

Python Package that scrapes Rate My Professor data.

###### ***[`pyvt`](https://github.com/VirginiaTech/pyvt)***

###### ***[Timetable-stalker](https://github.com/VirginiaTech/Timetable-Stalker)***

A python application to stalk the Virginia Tech course time table

###### ***[PScheduler](https://github.com/VirginiaTech/PScheduler)***
